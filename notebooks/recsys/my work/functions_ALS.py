    This function will take in the original user-item matrix and "mask" a percentage of the original ratings where a
    user-item interaction has taken place for use as a test set. The test set will contain all of the original ratings, 
    while the training set replaces the specified percentage of them with a zero in the original ratings matrix. 
    
    parameters: 
    
    ratings - the original ratings matrix from which you want to generate a train/test set. Test is just a complete
    copy of the original set. This is in the form of a sparse csr_matrix. 
    
    pct_test - The percentage of user-item interactions where an interaction took place that you want to mask in the 
    training set for later comparison to the test set, which contains all of the original ratings. 
    
    returns:
    
    training_set - The altered version of the original data with a certain percentage of the user-item pairs 
    that originally had interaction set back to zero.
    
    test_set - A copy of the original ratings matrix, unaltered, so it can be used to see how the rank order 
    compares with the actual interactions.
    
    user_inds - From the randomly selected user-item indices, which user rows were altered in the training data.
    This will be necessary later when evaluating the performance via AUC.

    '''
    Implicit weighted ALS taken from Hu, Koren, and Volinsky 2008. Designed for alternating least squares and implicit
    feedback based collaborative filtering. 
    
    parameters:
    
    training_set - Our matrix of ratings with shape m x n, where m is the number of users and n is the number of items.
    Should be a sparse csr matrix to save space. 
    
    lambda_val - Used for regularization during alternating least squares. Increasing this value may increase bias
    but decrease variance. Default is 0.1. 
    
    alpha - The parameter associated with the confidence matrix discussed in the paper, where Cui = 1 + alpha*Rui. 
    The paper found a default of 40 most effective. Decreasing this will decrease the variability in confidence between
    various ratings.
    
    iterations - The number of times to alternate between both user feature vector and item feature vector in
    alternating least squares. More iterations will allow better convergence at the cost of increased computation. 
    The authors found 10 iterations was sufficient, but more may be required to converge. 
    
    rank_size - The number of latent features in the user/item feature vectors. The paper recommends varying this 
    between 20-200. Increasing the number of features may overfit but could reduce bias. 
    
    seed - Set the seed for reproducible results
    
    returns:
    
    The feature vectors for users and items. The dot product of these feature vectors should give you the expected 
    "rating" at each point in your original matrix.
